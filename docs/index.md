## Welcome to GeoWater Research Group @ Peking University

We study the geography of global inland waters, their responses to the climate change and human perturbations, as well as their feedback to the climate/human systems.

We jointly use high-resolution global hydrologic models, space observations, and data-driven methods to understand global water problems.
